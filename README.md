# GPA scraper and calculator for FCI-CU
Chrome extension to scrape an FCI-CU student's ecom account and calculate their GPA from its data.

## How to use
It's not done yet. Will explain how to use here when done.

## I'm using Mozilla Firefox
Most of the code is about `XMLHttpRequest`, something not specifically related to Chrome, so most probably it'll be easy to port to a Firefox plugin.

## Next Steps
- Take input through `popup` and design it.
- Calculate and show the GPA in popup.
- Open a new tab that has all the results nicely aligned.
- Edit README
